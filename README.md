- Have users sign in with google and create a profile for their dog and display their match. Each match is posted on a board for others to see.

- Allow users to "unmatch"(delete) a match and create a brand new one until they find their perfect match.

#### Strech Goals

- Use Facebook and twitter API to allow users to share their matches.
